# Remove legacy NAV1 & page-level search

- [ ] Delete any `NAV1` component files and imports across the app.
- [ ] Remove page-specific search bars; rely on the global AppBar search (`/search?q=`).
- [ ] Ensure the GAIA/G logo at top-left returns to `/` (provided in `AppBar.tsx`).
- [ ] Remove any standalone `/quick-search` routes/pages.
